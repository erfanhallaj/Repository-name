# Erfan Hallaj – Profile & Resume

## 🎯 Title
**AI-Powered Trading Systems Developer | Crypto, NFT & DeFi Algorithmic Trader (7+ years)**

---

## 📋 Overview

I am **Erfan Hallaj**, an algorithmic trader and Python developer with **7+ years of experience** in financial markets. My background covers **crypto, DeFi, NFT trading, and FX**, with a strong focus on **systematic NFT flipping on OpenSea (Ethereum)** and liquidity-focused strategies on **PancakeSwap and Uniswap**.

I specialize in building **fully automated, self-learning trading systems in Python**. These systems use AI/ML models to learn market conditions, test multiple strategies on live data, and then **auto-adjust and "self-repair"** their parameters to improve **daily win rate** over time. In the first few hours of execution, the bot runs an intensive learning phase, evaluates different strategies, and then stabilizes into a configuration optimized for the current market regime (crypto, FX, NFT, or DeFi).
