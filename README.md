## Erfan Hallaj – Profile & Resume

**Title:**  
AI-Powered Trading Systems Developer \| Crypto, NFT & DeFi Algorithmic Trader (7+ years)

**Overview**  
I am **Erfan Hallaj**, an algorithmic trader and Python developer with **7+ years of experience** in financial markets. My background covers **crypto, DeFi, NFT trading, and FX**, with a strong focus on **systematic NFT flipping on OpenSea (Ethereum)** and liquidity-focused strategies on **PancakeSwap and Uniswap**.  

I specialize in building **fully automated, self-learning trading systems in Python**. These systems use AI/ML models to learn market conditions, test multiple strategies on live data, and then **auto-adjust and “self-repair”** their parameters to improve **daily win rate** over time. In the first few hours of execution, the bot runs an intensive learning phase, evaluates different strategies, and then stabilizes into a configuration optimized for the current market regime (crypto, FX, NFT or DeFi).  

My current development roadmap includes:  
- Self-learning trading bots for **crypto markets** (spot & derivatives)  
- An **auto-calibrating precious metals trading bot** (gold, silver, etc.)  
- An **NFT sniper bot on Ethereum** (OpenSea and related marketplaces)  
- Dedicated **DeFi self-learning systems on PancakeSwap and Uniswap** focused on precise liquidity pool hunting  

I work both on **my own research projects** and on **custom solutions for clients**, together with a **3-person team** focused on:  
- Smart trading bots  
- Automated analytics tools  
- AI-driven decision support for traders and investment operations  

**Core Skills & Technologies**  
- Python (clean, production-oriented code)  
- Algorithmic trading – Crypto, FX, NFT, DeFi  
- OpenSea (ETH) – NFT flipping strategies  
- DeFi on PancakeSwap & Uniswap – liquidity pool analysis & automation  
- AI & Machine Learning for trading strategy optimization and self-learning systems  
- Telegram bots & API-based automation for exchanges  

**What I can build for you**
